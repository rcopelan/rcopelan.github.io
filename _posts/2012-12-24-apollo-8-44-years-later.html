Those of us who were around in 1968 remember watching as Jim Lovell, Frank Borman and Bill Anders read from Genesis while orbiting the moon.&nbsp; Most people have seen the iconic pictures they took of the Earth.. "the blue marble".&nbsp;&nbsp; Those words spoken by the first 3 humans to leave the influence of this Earth had so much more meaning while being able to look at the complete Earth.&nbsp; We truly are one human race on this little marble.&nbsp; Only 7 months&nbsp; and on the 3rd flights later we had improved the processes and&nbsp; Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were standing on the moon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For sure those years were turbulent times.&nbsp; I don't remember much of the riots and race issues.&nbsp; We were raised to treat our fellow man as equals so didn't understand much about the issues of the times. &nbsp; What is clear is that we went to the moon by focusing on a goal and achieving that goal. &nbsp; This is something that is lacking today. &nbsp; Our Legislative and Executive branches are mired in squabbles both within their own party and with the other party.&nbsp;&nbsp; They aren't able to do what is expected of EVERY successful business..... Have a balanced budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead they continue to argue, spend and take every opportunity to change the focus to something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks,&nbsp; Get it together.. FOCUS... Forget everything else.&nbsp; Pass a real budget and you'll find that a lot of other problems just go away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a bold step as we did in the space program.&nbsp;&nbsp; Republicans and Democrats, join with each other as you did in a joint session after the senseless attack on Gabriele Giffords.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get rid of the center aisle,&nbsp; In the new session sit with each other and work together for the American party.&nbsp; Enlist the support and draft some of your regular "every day guy and gal"&nbsp; constituents to work with you to really solve problems, not just talk about them.&nbsp; Don't talk to your colleagues... Talk WITH your colleagues.&nbsp; We have to work together and return this country to being innovative and leadership, not just on the political and peace front but in industry and to be a place where we can be proud of the people we elect to governmental office because of what they do.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The&nbsp; Mercury 7, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, MIR and ISS astronauts and cosmonauts took and are taking bold steps in space exploration.&nbsp; We have so much because of that focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those of us who are Earthbound should do the same.&nbsp;<br />
