<span lang="DE">As of&nbsp; 8PM EST the current Pebble Time campaign has gone to #5 all time Kickstarter funding with 32,562 &nbsp;backers and 6,835,152 USD pledged! &nbsp;They have already broken Kickstarter records today and are on the way to the #1 spot again. &nbsp;<u></u></span></div>

<span lang="DE">I do have a first generation Pebble and have written an app or 2 for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;During the last 1.5 years or so I’ve been impressed that Pebble has made continuous improvements in the firmware as well as the interfaces using the Pebble app.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a magic combination of a good price point (199 USD msrp for the Pebble Time, less for the current models) for the device and a continuous improvement of the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; They embrace and support their developer community providing a free and open SDK and online development IDE in the Cloud.&nbsp; &nbsp;<u></u><u></u></span></div>

<span lang="DE">I believe that with the new features on the watch (read about them at the above link) when paired with a phone/tablet brings Pebble into being a valid enterprise level device at a good price point. &nbsp;&nbsp;It won’t be the „eierlegende Wollmilchsau“ but no company really needs that.&nbsp; &nbsp;What people do need is a device that is easy to see providing a visual and possible audio interface back to their main smart device.&nbsp; That main device can and should do the heavy processing and interfacing with the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this combination the battery life of the watch&nbsp; can be optimized.&nbsp; Each device can do what it does best.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></span></div>

<span lang="DE" style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 16.5pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">“We challenged people to start with blank slate,” he says. “It could be software, it could be hardware, it could be a watch, it could be not a watch. Just walk me through a day in the life.&nbsp;<span style="background: yellow;">We focused on a day because one of our stated goals and my core belief is that we want to make technology that is with you every single day of your life</span>. There were some pretty crazy ideas.”</span></div>

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;Eric Migicovsky is clearly a visionary in the wearable space. &nbsp;This version of the Pebble will move into the mainstream enterprise. &nbsp;Eric and all Pebblers are showing that laser focus and being OPEN can win! &nbsp;It is time for corporate IT departments to wake up and realize this.&nbsp;</span></div>
