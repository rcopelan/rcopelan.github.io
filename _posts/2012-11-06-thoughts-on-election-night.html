As I sit here tonight listening to the same comments being repeated over and over in the media I think about what this election means to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that the outcome of the election will affect this country for many more than the next 4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of who wins&nbsp; he can not by himself correct the issues we face.&nbsp; It will take every one of us pushing our elected officials to correct issues, balance the budget (heck, even just pass a budget)&nbsp; and move us forward with innovation in energy, manufacturing and other areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
JFK said it best on Sept. 12, 1962 at Rice University when he laid out his plan for the space program: <i>"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are
easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win,
and the others, too."&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>That speech galvanized a nation to achieve what many thought impossible and to do it in the next 8 short years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need that again, not only in our quest in space but here on earth too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have heard from some people that they will leave the country of Obama wins, others say they will leave if Romney wins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks, this is OUR country.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to all stay and work to make it a better place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am reminded of one of the first things I learned at The Citadel, right after the 3 standard answers....the Cadet Prayer, written by Bishop Albert S. Thomas, Ret, Class of 1892:<br />
<br />
<b>Almighty God, the source of light and strength, we implore Thy 
blessing on this our beloved institution, that it may continue true to 
its high purposes.</b><br />
<br />

<b>Guide and strengthen those upon whom rests the authority of 
government; enlighten with wisdom those who teach and those who learn; 
and grant to all of us that through sound learning and firm leadership, 
we may prove ourselves worthy citizens of our country, devoted to truth,
 given to unselfish service, loyal to every obligation of life and above
 all to Thee.</b><br />
<br />

<b>Preserve us faithful to the ideals of The Citadel, sincere in 
fellowship, unswerving in duty, finding joy in purity, and confidence 
through a steadfast faith.</b><br />

<b>Grant to each one of us, in his (her) own life, a humble heart, a 
steadfast purpose, and a joyful hope, with a readiness to endure 
hardship and suffer if need be, that truth may prevail among us and that
 Thy will may be done on earth. *Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen.</b><br />
<br />
Improving this country is a&nbsp; challenge is one that we must be willing to accept, one we can not&nbsp; postpone and one which we intend to win.<br />
