Three events in recent times are sticking in my head.&nbsp; Not because of the magnitude or impact but rather for the ability to totally refocus our attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; These events are:<br />
<ul>
<li>the "fiscal cliff" or as it should be called "the Executive and Legislative branchs' inability to govern" or perform&nbsp; to the same standards expected by every normal business</li>
<li>the Bengahazi consulate attack&nbsp;</li>
<li>several active shooter incidents over the last weeks</li>
<li>the Sandy Hook Elementary School active shooter incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Each of these events is a tragedy but keep in mind that there are shootings every day.&nbsp; It doesn't take a massacre to have an impact on an individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you or your family is in the wrong spot and the wrong time it will impact you the same as if&nbsp; there are multiple victims.<br />
<br />
Two things should have our focus in these weeks:<br />
First, don't let our Congress and President get sidetracked from their job of passing a budget.&nbsp; For them it must be the number one priority. They can debate gun control (pro and con) AFTER they do their job of stopping wasteful spending and pass a workable budget&nbsp; not more continuing resolutions.&nbsp; They should do nothing else until this is completed, delivered to the White House and signed.&nbsp; Stop blaming party A or party B.&nbsp; Forget the parties (both holiday and political)&nbsp; and get it done.&nbsp; Without that this country goes into a financial crisis.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Second:&nbsp; Say a prayer for those that are directly impacted by these events&nbsp; then 
get angry and make sure that you are prepared so that it doesn't happen 
to you. (and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to start carrying a weapon)&nbsp; Become aware of your surroundings.&nbsp; Do you know what you would do if an active shooter walks into your office, the mall or the grocery store when you are there.&nbsp; Are you always aware of what and who is around you in a 360 degree bubble?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know your company's plan for an active shooter?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they even have one?&nbsp; Don't say&nbsp; "it won't happen here". &nbsp; The only statement that is valid is "It hasn't happened here yet". &nbsp; Go to work tomorrow and ask your Safety Coordinator or HR&nbsp; if there is a plan.&nbsp; Insist that one is in place and exercised just like fire drills.&nbsp; (and for sure the same plan does NOT work for both).&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine what would happen if&nbsp; half of the workforce showed up at the office door asking this question.&nbsp; It will get noticed. <br />
<br />
The article at <a href="http://www.policeone.com/active-shooter/articles/2058168-Lt-Col-Dave-Grossman-to-cops-The-enemy-is-denial/" target="_blank">http://www.policeone.com/active-shooter/articles/2058168-Lt-Col-Dave-Grossman-to-cops-The-enemy-is-denial/</a>&nbsp; is a good read for more information. <br />
<br />
Stay safe and keep aware. <br />
