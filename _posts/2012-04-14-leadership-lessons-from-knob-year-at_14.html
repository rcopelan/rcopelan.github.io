Reading the various Facebook posts today about the <a href="http://externalaffairs.citadel.edu/recognition_day_classof2015" target="_blank">recognition of the Class of 2015</a> brought together some thoughts I've been having about 
early influences on my leadership style.&nbsp; The first influences were 18 
years of examples by my parents of how to be a good person and treat 
people correctly.<br />
<br />
In late August of 1977 the 2nd step 
of leadership training began.&nbsp; That first day was sensory overload where
 we began learning how to be good followers. The biggest leadership 
lesson of that day was the 3 answers: "Sir Yes Sir", "Sir No Sir", "Sir 
No Excuse Sir".&nbsp; Particularly that last answer is one that is key to 
being a good leader:&nbsp; Not giving excuses but rather taking 
responsibility for issues and mistakes. &nbsp;&nbsp; 34 years later it still gets 
used even when&nbsp; in some cases it should be used by someone else.&nbsp; 
Responsibility is a big thing that is missing in so many companies 
today. <br />
<br />
Looking back over that year there were examples
 of bad leadership, those we won't mention.&nbsp; There were also examples of
 good, even great leadership. &nbsp; Our cadet company commander lead by 
example.&nbsp; He was firm but fair. When we had PT runs or other activities 
he participated.&nbsp; There was one particular time where the famous Mr. 
Rampey would not allow a flat top haircut due to "regulations that 
didn't allow blocked hair cuts". &nbsp; The CO stood up for the knob who 
wanted it and even wrote a memo to the tac officer and Mr. Rampey 
regarding the issue.&nbsp; He didn't have to do that and it didn't change Mr.
 Rampey's decision but it taught that knob an important lesson: &nbsp; 
Support your people. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This company commander is now a Lt. General 
and is the Commanding General of the NATO Training Command in 
Afghanistan.&nbsp; I have heard from people with first hand knowledge that he
 leads in the same way today: up front, with his people and pulling his 
own weight. <br />
<br />
Others of the cadre that year taught&nbsp; us 
that being firm doesn't mean not being sadistic (though some of my 
classmates might disagree). &nbsp;&nbsp; "Racking" (running in place, push-ups and
 other things) was the method of discipline when there were minor 
infractions.&nbsp; Normally this was done by the cadet sargents and 
corporals.&nbsp; They were lead by the 1st Sgt, Asst 1Sgt and cadre platoon 
leader.&nbsp; ALL 3 of these gentlemen took this activity seriously and as a 
result most of the others did also. (as I mentioned at the top, there 
were a few exceptions).&nbsp; After breakfast there were usually a collection
 of us out on the 3rd division getting in some "rack" time.&nbsp; The cadre 
who were overseeing the activity were physically present.&nbsp; They didn't 
just start us up and then go in their room to get ready for class. &nbsp; 
Lesson Learned: &nbsp; discipline when needed should be in person. <br />
<br />
My
 advice for the Class of 2015 as you end your recognition activity this 
weekend: &nbsp; Take time to congratulate yourself on persevering though what
 more than likely has been the toughest year of your life.&nbsp; Be&nbsp; proud of
 that. For sure, those of us who came before you are proud of you.&nbsp; 
Tomorrow take some time to reflect back on&nbsp; the good leadership you have
 experienced and how that will help you.&nbsp; Also think about the bad 
examples and &nbsp; resolve NOT to do those things.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Congratulations, Class of 2015
