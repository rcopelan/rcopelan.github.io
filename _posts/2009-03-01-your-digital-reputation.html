<a href="http://thefuturebuzz.com/2009/02/28/digital-reputation/">http://thefuturebuzz.com/2009/02/28/digital-reputation/<br /></a><br /><br />I thought this was a good article. Sometimes we don't realize that sites such<br />as Facebook, Linkedin, mySpace, Twitter, mailing lists and so on are cataloged<br />and available for searching. Even if we have turned up maximum privacy, our<br />comments or pictures may be found on other people's sites that have less privacy.<br /><br />These days employers DO search these sites for information about prospective<br />employees. Speaking from my own experience, I google EVERYONE that is a business<br />partner. That "funny" picture at a party, slouching in a chair or comment that<br />might seem inappropriate when the background isn't known would be the one thing<br />that causes someone else to be chosen for a job.<br /><br />That certainly doesn't mean that we shouldn't use these new social media tools<br />but only that we should keep in mind how others would use them and how we want<br />others to view us. Yes, some things will get posted by others that we can't<br />control but we can control what we post and how we want the world to see us.<br /><br />Properly used, these social media sites can be a very powerful force that will<br />open doors to opportunity that a simple old-fashioned resume never would.
