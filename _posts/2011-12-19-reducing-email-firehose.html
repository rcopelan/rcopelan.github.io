In a recent discussion with a colleague he recommended that I read the book “The Hamster Revolution: How to Manage Your Email Before It Manages You”. This book has a humorous approach to explaining what we all know but are not able to do much about: eMail is wasting not hours but weeks of each of our productivity time per year. The techniques in this book seem logical so I am going to&nbsp;use them in 2012. <br />
<br />
As such you will see the following changes in the email you receive from me: <br />
<ul><li>the subject line will be formatted in this way:<br />
ACTION: descriptive subject (-eom)</li>
<ul><li>ACTION will be one of: <br />
<ul><li>ACTION</li>
<li>INFO</li>
<li>REQUEST</li>
<li>CONFIRMED – I have completed the subject action</li>
<li>DELIVERY – this email contains a response to a request you have made</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The subject will be descriptive of the contents and never blank</li>
<li>If “-eom” is included then the complete intelligence of the email is in the subject and you don’t need to open the email. Just read the subject line.</li>
</ul><li>The body will normally have 4 sections (this may take a while to work into):<br />
<ul><li>Brief greeting</li>
<li>ACTION: context, specific action, purpose and response time</li>
<li>BACKGROUND: clear, concise and relevant background. </li>
<li>CLOSE: next steps, signature block</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>Additionally, I’ll reduce the number of “thank you” email. If sent it will more than likely be just a brief note with “-eom” in the subject line. If your email does not require a reply then it’s more likely that there won’t be a reply at all ... thereby reducing the amount of email you receive. Know that I appreciate each value-added email received.<br />
<br />
This information will be revised as the new method develops.&nbsp; Check back here if you have any questions&nbsp; OR send me a “REQUEST:”&nbsp; email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
We would all benefit if each of us applied some simple email structure to this important communication tool.&nbsp;<br />
I highly recommend that you read “The Hamster Revolution …” and consider it for your own email process.&nbsp;
