<span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">There is an interesting article:</span></span><span lang="en-us"> </span><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/22/shadow_it/" target="_blank"><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><u><span style="color: blue; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">http://www.theregister.co.uk/<wbr></wbr>2012/03/22/shadow_it/</span></u></span><span lang="en-us"></span></a><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> about how people in the business departments are doing functions that really should be services provided by IT.&nbsp;</span></span><br />

<div dir="LTR"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Many years ago the same discussion</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">/problem existed</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> when departments</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> started using the new technology</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> like the Wang mini computers and</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">PC</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">’</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">s and discovered that they could solve problems using spreadsheets&nbsp; and access databases.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Geeky  engineers liked the ability to program the Wangs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of that  solution was to declare the mainframe systems that were tailor  programmed to be obsolete relics of the past and to move to  client-server systems that were smaller, lower cost and ran&nbsp;  off-the-shelf software that would</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">“</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">solve all problems"</span></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"></span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">.</span></span></div><div dir="LTR"><br />
</div><div dir="LTR"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Well, they weren't exactly the silver bullet that many had hoped for. &nbsp; The software produced by the leading providers is for sure flexible but it is very difficult for anyone to really know how to configure all the possible functions.&nbsp; Now we are back into the same situation but now with that very same</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">“</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">savior</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">”</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> client server software&nbsp; and a new era of portable computing devices where we carry massive power on our belts.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">  The software is run on huge server farms (ie: mega-MIPS systems) with  huge main memory capacity and almost unlimited (and low cost) disk  storage.&nbsp; (the</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">“</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">mainframe</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">”</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> of today)&nbsp; All of this is accessed by a GUI program running on a PC.</span></span><span lang="en-us"></span><span lang="en-us">&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"> This is not unlike the 3270 or 5250 green screens of before, just looks a little better.</span></span></div><div dir="LTR"><br />
</div><div dir="LTR"><span lang="en-us"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Have we  really improved or in order to solve the problems of today do we need to  go back to having highly customized applications to meet the business  needs?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the big software companies and the legions of consultants/analysts move fast enough to stay up with the fast changing world of social media and tablet/palm computing devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this causing companies to not be able to innovate their internal processes fast enough to stay world class leaders in their industry?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></div><div dir="LTR"><br />
