On May 19th I will join approximately 100 other folks at NASA's Johnson Space Center for an educational day and behind the scenes view of Mission Control during the STS-132 mission.   Since it's inception the Space Program has set the example of innovation, decision making, teamwork  and leadership.  One of my focuses (but not the only) during this day of opportunity will be to explore how NASA achieves such selfless teamwork where leaders and team members are so interchangeable.  <br />
<br />
Understanding and having these skills in the workforce will help companies become agile and able to respond to such issues as the economic crisis. <br />
