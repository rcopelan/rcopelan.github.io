Much has been said in various blogs about why to get an iPad or why to wait.  There is no need to rehash that.  There are good points for either decision.  As a geek, today was tough to watch the unboxing of 2 iPads on the <a href=http://www.twit.tv>TWiT Network</a> and not have one myself.  I will wait a while. Clearly  Apple has hit another "long drive" and scored multiple runs with the iPad just as they did with the iPod and iPhone.  <br /><br />These are paradigm changing devices and move us toward a future that we saw only in Star Trek and other SciFi movies not so many years ago. Some look at these devices and wonder  "why do I need it".  The real benefits become apparent only after obtaining one and discovering new ways of doing things.  Books don't go away, they just become more accessible.   Radio and TV becomes  audio/video podcasts or streaming networks such as TWiT.   Real time interactivity between show hosts and the audience, only a dream for the big networks, is already a reality for shows that are "connected". This is enhanced by these devices for those who embrace them. <br /><br />There is a healthy competition between between the iDevices and Android devices. Apple has again set a high bar for tablets in both hardware and software.  I expect that in the coming months we'll see other hardware for Android.  There is room for both and having both will ensure that companies as well as developers continue to innovate and improve.   <br /><br />Thank you Apple and Steve Jobs for moving the bar up a notch or 2.  The challenge will be met.
