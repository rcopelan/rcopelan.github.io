 4th of July everyone.   During the past weeks I've read a fair amount 
of passionate postings here on FB and on other sites from a number of 
people   pro and con about Paula Dean. Some of the people are taking 
their position very personally and lash out at the other side when there
 are disagreements. All of this is FREE publicity for Paula Dean and 
she, like others before her, will be the ultimate winner.  Disclaimer, I
 have never liked Paula Dean and nothing of the last weeks has changed 
that one way or the other.    <br /> <br /> Especially on this day we should
 think about what the signers of the Declaration of Independence were 
doing when they put that signature on the document.  They were putting 
their lives, their family's lives, their land, their money on the line. 
 They exposed themselves to capture and torture...and yes they committed
 treason against the, at that time legal, government.   They put in 
motion the movement that got us our republic<span class="text_exposed_show"> and our form of government.    <br /> <br />
 Are we willing to focus the same passion as we put into the Paula Dean 
discussion toward being a part of  government "of the people, by the 
people and for the people". Are we willing to hold our elected officials
 responsible for their actions  by voting them back into office if we 
agree with them or out of office if we don't.  Yes, it takes sacrifice, 
yes we have to get off the couch and GO to them, yes we have to give up 
some of the things we like to do in order to have time to help guide our
 government.  <br /> <br /> It doesn't come close to what those guys and 
gals did in 1776.  Are we willing to spend time to support getting those
 people into elected office that will work for the people?   Are we 
willing to take the energy spent on the trivial stuff and focus it 
toward a better tomorrow?</span></span></span></h5>
